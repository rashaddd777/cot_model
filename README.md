Commitment of Traders (COT) Analysis Tool

Overview

This is a private, personal trading tool developed using Commitment of Traders (COT) data combined with price data collected from 2006 to 2025. This document offers a brief glimpse into the analytical methodology I utilize to assess market positioning between Banks (Dealers) and Retail traders (Non-reportable).

For demonstration purposes, the visualizations presented here are limited to data from 2019 to 2024. The intention is to showcase the analytical approach without publishing the full model or comprehensive data set.


Core Concept

1. Banks (Dealers) typically lead the market.
2. My goal is to buy alongside banks when their positions are at a discount (historically low), anticipating upward market moves.
3. Conversely, I aim to sell with banks when their positions are at a premium (historically high), expecting downward market moves.
4. Additionally, I use retail trader positioning as a contrarian indicator—doing the opposite of the retail sentiment.


How the Analysis Works


1. Combines COT and historical price data.
2. Computes exponential moving averages (EMAs) for clear trend visibility.
3. Determines rolling relative positions (using 4-week, 13-week, and 52-week windows).
4. Clearly identifies when banks or retails are at extremes within their historical range.
5. Utilizes a blend of normalization methods (Min-Max, Z-score, Robust).
6. Applies advanced filters (Kalman, Butterworth, Quantile) for clearer signals.
7. Price trends with EMAs.
8. Banks' and Retail positions highlighting "premium" or "discount."


Understanding the Visuals
